# Testing Email Verification Feature

## ✅ Email Verification Successfully Implemented!

Your ZetsuServ application now has a fully functional email verification system with the beautiful UI design you provided.

## What's Been Implemented:

### 1. **Database Updates**
- Added email verification fields to User model:
  - `email_verification_code_hash` - Stores hashed verification code
  - `email_verification_expires_at` - Code expiration time (10 minutes)
  - `last_verification_sent_at` - Rate limiting for resend functionality

### 2. **Registration Flow**
- When users register, they receive a 6-digit verification code via email
- Users are redirected to the beautiful verification page you designed
- Registration is not complete until email is verified

### 3. **Login Protection**
- Unverified users cannot access the dashboard
- They're automatically redirected to verification page
- A fresh code is sent if the previous one expired

### 4. **Verification Page Features**
- Beautiful, responsive design matching your specifications
- 6 separate input boxes for the verification code
- Auto-focus navigation between inputs
- Copy-paste support for the full 6-digit code
- Resend functionality with 60-second cooldown timer
- Real-time visual feedback

### 5. **Security Features**
- Verification codes are hashed using bcrypt (never stored in plain text)
- Codes expire after 10 minutes
- Rate limiting on resend (60 seconds between requests)
- CSRF protection on all forms

## How to Test:

### Step 1: Configure Gmail (Required)
1. Open your `.env` file
2. Update these values with your Gmail credentials:
```env
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password-here  # NOT your Gmail password!
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=your-email@gmail.com
```

**Important:** You need a Gmail App Password, not your regular password. See `GMAIL_SETUP.md` for instructions.

### Step 2: Test Registration
1. Visit: http://localhost:5000/register
2. Fill in the registration form with a valid email
3. Click "Create Account"
4. Check your email for the 6-digit code
5. Enter the code on the verification page
6. Success! You're logged in

### Step 3: Test Login with Unverified Account
1. If you have an unverified account, try logging in
2. You'll be redirected to the verification page
3. A new code will be sent if needed

### Step 4: Test Resend Feature
1. On the verification page, click "Click to resend"
2. A new code will be sent to your email
3. The 60-second cooldown timer will start
4. You can't resend again until the timer expires

## Features Demonstration:

### 📱 Mobile Responsive
The verification page is fully responsive and works perfectly on all devices.

### ⌨️ Keyboard Navigation
- Tab through the code inputs
- Backspace to go to previous input
- Auto-advance to next input after entering a digit

### 📋 Copy-Paste Support
Users can copy the 6-digit code from their email and paste it directly - it will automatically fill all 6 boxes.

### 🔒 Security
- Codes are unique for each session
- Codes expire after 10 minutes
- Hashed storage prevents database breaches from exposing codes
- Rate limiting prevents spam

## Troubleshooting:

### If emails are not sending:
1. Check your `.env` file has correct Gmail settings
2. Make sure you're using an App Password, not your Gmail password
3. Check the console/terminal for error messages
4. Verify 2-Step Verification is enabled on your Gmail account

### If verification fails:
1. Make sure the code hasn't expired (10 minutes limit)
2. Check you entered all 6 digits correctly
3. Try resending a new code
